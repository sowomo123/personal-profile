1. Describe the main concepts you applied?
HTML Concepts

Document Structure: Every HTML document starts with <!DOCTYPE html>, followed by the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

The <head> contains metadata, including the <title>, <meta> tags for SEO, and links to CSS files.
The <body> houses all visible content.
Semantic HTML: Using meaningful tags, like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, helps to organize content, making it more readable for both humans and search engines.


Media Embedding: HTML supports embedding media like images, videos, and audio with <img>, <video>, and <audio> tags, providing a richer user experience.

CSS Concepts
Selectors: CSS selectors target HTML elements to apply styles, including:

Basic selectors (e.g., element, #id, .class)
Group selectors (h1, h2)
Pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :first-child)
Combinators (e.g., div > p for direct child selectors)
Box Model: Every element is a "box" with margin, border, padding, and content areas. Understanding the box model is critical for layout and spacing.

2. Discuss new skills or knowledge acquired
When learning web development, new skills and knowledge often emerge as you dive deeper into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design principles. Here are some key areas where i gain new skills and knowledge:

 Responsive Design

Advanced Media Queries: Learning how to create breakpoints beyond typical device sizes allows for better control over how a site looks on different screens.
Fluid Layouts and Responsive Units: Using units like vw, vh, %, and rem instead of fixed pixels helps in making a truly responsive design that adapts smoothly to any screen size.

CSS Variables and Custom Properties

CSS variables allow for greater consistency and flexibility, making it easy to manage themes and color schemes across an entire project.
Using custom properties helps in creating modular and reusable code, especially valuable in large projects or ones with different style themes.

 Design Systems and Component-Based Design

Learning how to create reusable components (such as buttons, cards, and navbars) enhances efficiency and consistency across a site.
Adopting a design system mindset helps to create a unified style guide that improves maintainability, particularly in large applications.

3. Discuss what you learned.

I enhanced my understanding of CSS properties, especially for typography, color schemes, and spacing.
I used custom properties (CSS variables) to define a consistent color palette, making it easy to update or change colors across the entire profile page if needed.
I learned the importance of managing the CSS box model effectively, using padding, margin, and border properties to control the spacing and positioning of elements.
Responsive Design:

I learned to apply media queries to make the profile page responsive, ensuring it looks good on both mobile and desktop screens. For instance, I used Flexbox to change the layout from a vertical to a horizontal alignment based on screen size.
Experimenting with responsive units (%, vw, vh, rem, em) helped me understand how different units impact responsiveness.

4. challenges and solution u faced?
 Challenge: Image Sizing and Aspect Ratio
Problem: Getting the profile image to maintain a consistent aspect ratio without becoming distorted was tricky, especially when resizing the screen.
Solution: I wrapped the image in a container and used object-fit: cover along with border-radius: 50% for a circular profile picture. This maintained the aspect ratio while creating a visually pleasing look.
